YOLOv11 Model Placeholder
=========================

This file serves as a placeholder for the YOLOv11 tomato leaf detection model.

REQUIRED FILE: yolov11_tomato_leaf.tflite

The actual YOLOv11 model file needs to be placed in this directory with the exact name:
    yolov11_tomato_leaf.tflite

Model Specifications:
- Input size: 640x640x3 (RGB image)
- Output: Bounding boxes with class probabilities for tomato leaf detection
- Format: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)

How to Obtain the Model:
------------------------

Option 1: Train Your Own Model
1. Collect and annotate tomato leaf images
2. Train YOLOv11 using Ultralytics framework
3. Export to TFLite format:
   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   model = YOLO('path/to/trained/model.pt')
   model.export(format='tflite', imgsz=640)
   ```

Option 2: Use Pre-trained Model
1. Download a pre-trained YOLOv11 model for plant/leaf detection
2. Fine-tune on tomato leaf dataset if needed
3. Export to TFLite format

Option 3: Development/Testing
For development without the actual model, you can:
- Use a generic YOLOv11 model trained on COCO dataset
- Download from: https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases
- Note: This will have lower accuracy for tomato-specific detection

Once you have the model file:
1. Rename it to: yolov11_tomato_leaf.tflite
2. Place it in this directory (app/src/main/assets/models/)
3. Delete this placeholder file
4. Rebuild the app

The app will automatically load the model from the path configured in:
    app/src/main/java/com/ml/tomatoscan/config/ModelConfig.kt

Model Configuration:
- Path: models/yolov11_tomato_leaf.tflite
- Input size: 640x640 (configured in ModelConfig.YOLO_INPUT_SIZE)
- Confidence threshold: 0.3 (configured in ModelConfig.DETECTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
- NMS IoU threshold: 0.45 (configured in ModelConfig.NMS_IOU_THRESHOLD)

For more details, see: app/src/main/assets/models/README.md
