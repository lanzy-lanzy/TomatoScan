MISSING MODEL FILE: tomato_disease_model.tflite

The TFLite disease classification model is missing from this location.

Expected location: app/src/main/assets/tomato_disease_model.tflite

To add the model:
1. Train or obtain a TFLite model for tomato disease classification
2. Place the model file at: app/src/main/assets/tomato_disease_model.tflite
3. Rebuild the app

The model should:
- Accept 224x224 RGB images as input
- Output probabilities for 6 disease classes:
  1. Bacterial Speck
  2. Early Blight
  3. Healthy
  4. Late Blight
  5. Leaf Mold
  6. Septoria Leaf Spot

Until the model is added, the app will run with degraded functionality:
- Disease classification will return UNCERTAIN results
- The analysis pipeline will still attempt to detect leaves using YOLOv11
- Gemini AI validation may still work if configured
